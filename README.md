# Christmas-Tree
Fun christmas tree PCB ornament with LEDs
* Base is roughly 5cm and its about 6.5cm tall
* Has a nice hole in it to make it an ornament

Used to be series, turns out that doesn't work so now its parallel. I don't really know how to nicely route parallel circuits so it looks ugly and **might not work**, maybe I'll try again next christmas
